A Hugo theme built special for Alex Bilson at https://alexbilson.dev/. It was originally a copy of Joe Hutchenson's Aether theme, but I've since rebuilt it from the ground up so there's zero similarity in code or function from the original.

I don't recommend using it for more than examples because it requires a custom build server to generate backlinks for my Markdown content. I've had trouble with Hugo reading a static JSON file and opted to run a sidecar service to fix it for now. If you're brave you can find it at acbilson/chaos-theme-service.
